If you are seeing this message, it means you are an individual who cares about freedom, who loves their country and are willing to go an extra mile to make sure their country is free. This is a secret message to such individuals, and it's the first of many. I created this tool to connect like minded citizens like yourself, who not only see the future of this country but are willing to fight for it, and to build a better one. This is your chance to express your thoughts for the future of the country and a chance to know what others are thinking about the future. For now I thought cleaning up the country, literally, is the first step to truly freeing her, and so the first project, The Kosmic Clean Up, was born (The K is Kosmic represents Kenya as you might have thought). What's more, every project posted here will be a decision made by the citizens. That's why you get a prompt asking for your thoughts on what we should do next, because next posted project will be compiled from all your inputs. Lastly, I mentioned secrets, well, like this one, those to come will require you to unlock them and the more you do the challenges(like uploading a trash photo in this case), the more GovCoins you gain, and GovCoins are the key to unlocking secrets. Next secret unlocks when you get to 100 GovCoins. Every project photo uploaded will be archived in our country's digital archive (which will be created by you, of course, through uploads) and can be access by clicking on "uploads" in the project description.
